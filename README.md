# PSL-Project 4: Movielense Data: Recommender System
Goals
In this project, our goal is to develop a content based recommendation system(System I) and collaborative recommendation system(System II).

System I: is recommendation based on genres. We ask user to input their favorite Genre, and we provide two recommendation schemes:
Method I: High Rated Movies.
Method II: High Rate Popularity based on number of votes.
I have used python for this task, simply because I find data manipulation is easier in Python.

System II: is a collaborative recommendation system. User will provide rating for couple of movies for this and this System will recommend movies based on this input. I have used following two methods for this.

User-based (UBCF): This method works on the assumption that similar users have similar taste. UBCF uses the logic and recommends items by finding similar users to the user.

Item-based (IBCF): This method finds similarities between different items by using similarity measure, these similarity values are used to predict.
